# duEuler Foundation v3.0 - Enterprise Development Framework

## Overview

A comprehensive enterprise-grade development foundation for building scalable web applications that grow from prototype to enterprise scale (1 user → 1M+ users).

**Official Repository:** https://github.com/duEuler/duEulerWebSite
**Foundation Version:** 3.0 - Production Ready

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize new project with duEuler Foundation
node dueuler-foundation/automation/foundation-setup.cjs

# Select capacity tier (NANO/MICRO/SMALL/LARGE/ENTERPRISE)
# System automatically configures templates and dependencies
```

## Capacity Tiers

- **NANO** (1-1K users): Basic React + Express setup
- **MICRO** (1K-10K users): PostgreSQL + Redis + JWT authentication  
- **SMALL** (10K-50K users): Docker + Load balancing + Advanced monitoring
- **MEDIUM** (50K-200K users): Enhanced performance + Enterprise features
- **LARGE** (200K-1M users): ✅ **VERIFIED** - 8GB RAM, 8 cores, Prometheus + Grafana
- **ENTERPRISE** (1M+ users): Zero-trust security + ML/AI + Service mesh

## Features

### Template System (20+ Types)
- Package.json configurations for all tiers
- Docker Compose orchestration
- TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite configurations
- Testing frameworks and CI/CD pipelines

### Enterprise Systems
- ✅ **Prometheus + Grafana monitoring** (100% tested - LARGE capacity verified)
- ✅ **Authentication System** (Bearer token implementation working)
- ✅ **Foundation Integration** (FoundationIntegrator with capacity-specific configs)
- ✅ **Real-time Dashboard** (Foundation metrics with live capacity display)
- ELK Stack observability (95% complete)
- Distributed tracing and APM
- Zero-trust security architecture

## Recent Updates (July 2025)

### Authentication Fix ✅
- Fixed frontend/backend authorization mismatch
- sessionId now properly included in all API requests
- Dashboard now displays real-time Foundation capacity information

### Foundation Integration ✅  
- Implemented proper FoundationIntegrator system
- Capacity upgrades now apply specific configurations (Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Added preview functionality before applying changes

### UX Improvements ✅
- Removed redundant "access level" field from login
- Role now determined automatically by user account
- Enhanced dashboard with Foundation capacity details

### Automation
- Intelligent template selection
- Dependency resolution per tier
- Environment configuration
- Deployment automation
