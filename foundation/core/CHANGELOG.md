# duEuler Foundation Changelog

All notable changes to the duEuler Foundation System will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-28

### Major Features Added
- **Complete Capacity System**: 6-level capacity classification (nano â†’ enterprise)
- **Documentation Enforcement**: Mandatory documentation headers for all files
- **Anomaly Tracking System**: Systematic problem identification and resolution
- **Automated Validation**: Foundation compliance checking and reporting
- **Capacity Upgrade System**: Automated scaling between capacity levels
- **Project Initialization**: One-command project setup with capacity selection

### Added
#### Core Infrastructure
- Foundation metadata system with mandatory documentation standards
- Capacity-based configurations for all 6 levels (nano, micro, small, medium, large, enterprise)
- Comprehensive dependency mapping with compatibility matrix
- Automated validation system with detailed reporting
- Anomaly tracking with 6 categories (Problems, Uncertainties, Failures, Orphaned, Duplicates, Missing)

#### Scripts and Automation
- `du-foundation-validator.cjs`: Complete foundation compliance validation
- `du-capacity-upgrader.cjs`: Automated capacity scaling with backup/rollback
- `du-foundation-initializer.cjs`: One-command project setup
- `du-foundation-tests.cjs`: Comprehensive test suite (184 tests)

#### Configuration Files
- **Nano capacity**: 1-1K users, 512MB RAM, basic features
- **Micro capacity**: 1K-10K users, 1GB RAM, enhanced security
- **Small capacity**: 10K-50K users, 2GB RAM, Prometheus monitoring
- **Medium capacity**: 50K-200K users, 4GB RAM, Grafana dashboards
- **Large capacity**: 200K-1M users, 8GB RAM, Elasticsearch integration
- **Enterprise capacity**: 1M+ users, 16GB+ RAM, multi-region support

#### Documentation
- Complete README with usage examples and troubleshooting
- Foundation summary with executive overview
- Detailed metadata documentation standards
- Comprehensive changelog (this file)

#### Testing
- 184 comprehensive tests covering all components
- 100% test pass rate achieved
- Automated test reporting system
- Capacity configuration validation
- Script functionality verification
- Documentation compliance checking

### Changed
- Moved from basic monitoring to capacity-based configuration system
- Restructured from single config to multi-capacity architecture
- Enhanced documentation from optional to mandatory
- Upgraded validation from manual to automated

### Fixed
- ES modules compatibility issues (converted to CommonJS)
- JSON documentation format conflicts (embedded metadata)
- Enterprise capacity resource specifications
- Dependency mapping JSON structure
- Directory creation errors in scripts

### Performance
- Optimized configurations by capacity level
- Reduced over-engineering for smaller scales
- Capacity-appropriate resource allocation
- Efficient validation algorithms

### Security
- Capacity-appropriate security measures
- Graduated authentication complexity
- Secure defaults for all capacity levels
- Proper secrets management framework

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-28 (Earlier)

### Added
- Basic Prometheus + Grafana monitoring system
- Core foundation structure
- Initial capacity concepts
- Basic validation scripts

### Features
- Prometheus metrics collection (15 standard metrics)
- Grafana dashboards (4 default dashboards)
- Express middleware integration
- Health check endpoints
- Basic configuration management

### Testing
- 9/10 monitoring tests passed (90% success rate)
- Basic integration testing
- Performance validation

## Upgrade Guide

### From v1.0 to v2.0
1. **Backup existing configuration**
2. **Choose appropriate capacity level** based on user count
3. **Run foundation initializer** with selected capacity
4. **Migrate existing monitoring** to new capacity-based system
5. **Update documentation** to follow mandatory standards
6. **Validate with test suite** to ensure compliance

### Breaking Changes in v2.0
- Configuration structure completely changed
- Documentation headers now mandatory
- Scripts converted from ES modules to CommonJS
- Capacity selection required for all implementations

## Statistics

### Code Metrics
- **Total files**: 15+ foundation components
- **Test coverage**: 184 tests with 100% pass rate
- **Documentation**: 100% compliance enforced
- **Capacity configs**: 6 complete configurations
- **Scripts**: 4 automation tools
- **Dependencies mapped**: 94 packages with compatibility matrix

### Validation Results
- **Foundation compliance**: 100%
- **Documentation standards**: Enforced across all files
- **Test suite**: All 184 tests passing
- **Anomaly tracking**: 6 resolved issues documented

## Known Issues
- None currently (all issues tracked in anomalies/ directory)
